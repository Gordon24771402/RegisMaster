The project is created for checking future SAT registration automatically. Simply input your username and password, and the program will do the rest for you! You will be notified once the future registration is available!

Selenium webdriver first uses the 127.0.0.1:8080 (mitmproxy) to filter out the potential recognition for a webdriver, then mitmproxy forwards the request to upstream proxy to connect the Internet.

Replace "USERNAME" in "user_name.send_keys("USERNAME")" with yours.

Replace "PASSWORD" in "password.send_keys("PASSWORD")" with yours.
